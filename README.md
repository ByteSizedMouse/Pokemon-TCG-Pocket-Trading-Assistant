How to use the program:
1. Make an account on https://ptcgp-tracker.com/ and enter your collection.
2. Export your collection as multiple .csv files (one for each set, because there is no option to download your full collection unfortunately).
3. Launch the program and click "Select Files" Button to upload the .csv files for each collector. Multiple files can be selected.
4. Press "Show trade!" and the program will display possible trade options for both players.

Note:
The program displays only cards that are duplicates of a player that happen to be missing from among the other collector's card pool. (less than 2 copies)
This program was written on the basis of working with the generated .csv files from https://ptcgp-tracker.com/.
Since these do not include data regarding the rarity, I was unfortunately not able to filter by rarity. Should this change, I intend to update the program accordingly.

I hope you enjoy!
